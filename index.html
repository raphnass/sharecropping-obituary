            <p>
                The system failed because it was designed to keep people trapped. Poor white Southerners didn't own land, which meant they couldn't get loans from anyone except the landlord whose land they were already working. That landlord also ran the only store they could buy from, charging interest rates between 25 and 70 percent. Every risk-bad weather, crop failure, falling prices-fell on the tenant. The landlord's cut was guaranteed first, so when something went wrong, only the sharecropper's family went hungry. And when federal troops left in 1877, there was nobody enforcing fair treatment. Landlords controlled the records, set the prices, and decided what the crops were worth. There was no way to fight back.

                These ledgers are based on real records from the LeFlore plantation in Mississippi (1867-1869) and Georgia sharecropper account books (1866-1868). They show what typically happened to poor white tenant farmers caught in this system.

                    <strong>Context:</strong> During these years, cotton sold for 24-29 cents per pound. Sharecroppers had to give 50-67% of their crop to landlords as rent, then buy supplies from plantation stores at prices 25-70% higher than cash, with interest added on top. Landlords controlled how much the crop was worth and kept all the financial records, so there was no way to check if you were getting cheated.

                    <strong>What this shows:</strong> Year 1, you work all year and barely make $53. Year 2, one setback (illness, bad weather) puts you in debt that compounds with interest. By Year 3, cotton prices drop and the debt is mathematically impossible to pay off. You'd have to work without eating to break even. That's the trap.

                <h4>Why Debt Increased Despite Labor</h4>
                <p>Debt went up even when people worked hard because the landlord controlled everything that mattered. When cotton prices dropped, the tenant ate the loss but still owed the same amount for supplies they'd bought at markup. The landlord decided what the harvest was worth at the end of the year, and there were no written contracts or books tenants could check. So even if you had a good crop, the landlord could value it low and add mystery charges. The North Carolina Landlord Tenant Acts from 1868 and 1877 actually made this legal-landlords didn't have to show you the numbers or put anything in writing. You just had to take their word for it. No amount of work could beat a system where the other person decides how much your work is worth.
            </div>

            <div class="analysis-block">
                <h4>Structural Mechanisms That Prevented Escape</h4>
                <p>Three things locked people in with no way out. First, if you don't own land, you can't use it as collateral for a loan. That meant the only person who would lend you money was your landlord, who already controlled your income. Second, you had to buy everything from the plantation store because that's where your credit was. Prices there were 25-70% higher than paying cash, plus interest on top of that. And the landlord was usually both your lender and the person buying your crop-massive conflict of interest. Third, debt rolled over every year with interest. Once you fell behind, you couldn't catch up because each harvest paid last year's debt before this year's work got compensated. One bad harvest, one sick family member, one price drop, and you were done. The hole just got deeper no matter how hard you worked.

            <div class="analysis-block">
                <h4>Why There Were No Alternatives</h4>
                <p>There weren't better options because the war destroyed everything else. Buying land required money that didn't exist-when you're starting with nothing, even cheap land is impossible. Moving to a city cost money you didn't have, and there were no guaranteed jobs there anyway. Wage labor paid even worse than sharecropping. And the crop-lien system followed you if you moved, so switching landlords just meant the same problems somewhere else. After Reconstruction ended in 1877, the legal system stopped protecting anyone. Courts wouldn't rule against landowners, and poor people had no political power to change the laws that kept this whole thing running. Your options were sharecropping under these terms or leaving the South entirely with no money to actually do it.</p>

            <h3>Legacy</h3>
            <p>
                Here's what the system left behind: it made poor white people easy to manipulate politically. When you're drowning in debt despite working from sunrise to sunset, you need someone to blame. Southern elites gave them a target-freed Black people competing for the same resources. It wasn't the landlord class keeping both groups poor; it was racial competition. This was genius for the elites because it redirected real economic anger into support for Jim Crow laws and Black disenfranchisement. Poor whites ended up supporting the exact same planter class that was exploiting them, because they'd been convinced the enemy was other poor people, not the system itself. The sharecropping system died, but it taught rich Southerners how to keep power: convince poor people to fight each other instead of looking up.

            <h3>Final Words</h3>
            <p>
                The sharecropping system shows that Reconstruction didn't fail because the laws were too extreme-it failed because the economic setup never changed. The 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments gave people rights on paper, but when you don't own land and you're buried in debt, those rights don't mean much in practice. Both poor whites and freed Black people needed actual land to be independent, but the federal government gave confiscated property back to ex-Confederates instead. When troops left in 1877, all the legal equality collapsed because there was nothing economic holding it up. What this proves is that political freedom without economic security doesn't last. People with power will just take it back. That's not just a Reconstruction lesson.
